## The Problem

Getting a loan shouldn't require a bank, a credit score, or weeks of paperwork. Yet billions of dollars in crypto sit idle in wallets — earning nothing — while people who need short-term capital have no way to access it without selling their holdings.

Traditional lending platforms are either **centralized** (your funds are controlled by a company that can freeze them, change terms, or go bankrupt) or **complex** (requiring deep DeFi knowledge just to get started).

Bitcoin holders face an additional challenge: there are very few lending options that let you **keep your Bitcoin exposure** while accessing liquidity.

## The Solution

**OnLoan** is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer lending and borrowing protocol built on the [Stacks blockchain](https://www.stacks.co/) — a Bitcoin Layer 2. It connects lenders who want to earn yield with borrowers who need capital, all through transparent smart contracts.

**For Lenders:** Deposit USDCx, sBTC, or STX into lending pools and earn interest from borrowers. Your funds work for you — and you can withdraw anytime there's available liquidity.

**For Borrowers:** Deposit sBTC or STX as collateral, and instantly borrow USDCx. Keep your crypto exposure while accessing the capital you need. Real-time Pyth oracle pricing ensures fair, transparent collateral valuations.

**No backend servers. No custodians. No hidden fees.** Every interest rate, every collateral ratio, and every liquidation threshold is computed on-chain in Clarity smart contracts that anyone can read and verify.

## How It Works

```
  Lender                                      Borrower
    │                                            │
    │  1. Deposit USDCx/sBTC/STX                 │  1. Deposit sBTC or STX
    │     into Lending Pool                      │     as collateral
    │         │                                  │         │
    │         ▼                                  │         ▼

    │         │                                    │
    │  3. Earn interest                   3. Repay loan + interest
    │     from borrows                       to reclaim collateral
```
